        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>From my first job in Retail Photography to my most recent role testing e-Commerce technologies, whether it be
            "manager" or "individual contributor" the commonality in my work history is Retail.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I learned all I know from the university of life. (Have you seen the cost of formal education in the USA?)</p>
        <p>Courtesy of my employers investing in me through various retail management training programs, 
            I was able to be a successful retail leader for many years. After crossing over into the Information Technology 
            domain in 2015, I have taken various courses to grow and stay relevant.
